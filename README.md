    abstract = "This report presents deep learning and data augmentation techniques used by a system entered into the Few-Shot Bioacoustic Event Detection for the DCASE2021 Challenge. The remit was to develop a few-shot learning system for animal (mammal and bird) vocalisations. Participants were tasked with developing a method that can extract information from five exemplar vocalisations, or shots, of mammals or birds and detect and classify sounds in field recordings. In the system described in this report, prototypical networks are used to learn a metric space, from which classification is performed by computing the distance of a query point to class prototypes, classifying based on shortest distance. We describe the architecture of this network, feature extraction methods, and data augmentation performed on the given dataset and compare our work to the challenge's baseline networks"
